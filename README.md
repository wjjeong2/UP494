**Notes:** 

- You should modify this readme file and the accompanying folder structure as needed to reflect the work you have contracted to complete this semester.
- Please update the above table to reflect the date you have uploaded files for evaluation. Please add notes to explain what each folder contains or if there are any special considerations.
- The .gitkeep files you see in empty folders are there so that GitHub uploads the empty folders to the repository. Git (the software on which GitHub is built) is designed to track content - empty folders don't contain content, so they are not tracked.
